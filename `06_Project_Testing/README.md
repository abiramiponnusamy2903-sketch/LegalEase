## AI Integration Testing

The Google Gemini integration was tested by submitting valid document-generation requests.

The system successfully:

1. Received user information.
2. Created the document-generation request.
3. Sent the request to Google Gemini.
4. Received the generated content.
5. Returned the generated content to the frontend.
6. Displayed the generated document.

## Deployment Testing

The deployed backend and frontend were tested to verify communication between the Streamlit frontend and FastAPI backend.

The application successfully generated a legal document using the deployed services.

## Test Result

The major functional components of LegalEase were successfully tested.

The application was able to accept user input, communicate with the backend, generate an AI-assisted legal document using Google Gemini, display the generated content, allow editing, and provide TXT download functionality.
